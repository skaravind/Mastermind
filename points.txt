                             **** POINTS SCHEME ****

IN THE MASTERMIND GAME, WE HAVE MADE A SPECIAL POINTS SCHEME WHICH GIVES YOU POINTS USING THE FORMULA :-

POINTS = (500-tr) + (5000-tm)

where,  tr = no of tries you took
 and      tm = time taken by you in sec

THIS PROVIDES YOU WITH A BETTER WAY TO COMPARE YOUR PERFORMANCE EACH TIME YOU PLAY.......
